Here's an example of an Animal class. 

An animal instance is created when you call the Animal constructor passing in a string that represents the sound that an animal makes.
The sayHello method console logs the animal's sound. 

setTimeout has been called 6 different ways at the bottom of the file. The intention is for "meow" to be logged to the console 3 seconds after the code is run. 

Which invocations worked as expected and which do not? Why?
